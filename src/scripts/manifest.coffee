    description: """
      Year 1 final project required the design of a small structure on the coast.
      Students were given full freedom to choose their programme.
      The Meditation Space is a timber pod for a few people to enjoy soothing effect of the beauty of the surrounding nature.
      The shape of the rocks found along the shoreline was the main inspiration behind the design.
      The idea was to create a form that would resemble the nature of the surroundings, but not blend in completely to signify the spiritual importance of the Meditation Space.
