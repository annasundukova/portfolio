      <p>Year 1 final project required the design of a small structure on the coast.</p>
      <p>Students were given full freedom to choose their programme.</p>
      <p>The Meditation Space is a timber pod for a few people to enjoy soothing effect of the beauty of the surrounding nature.</p>
      <p>The shape of the rocks found along the shoreline was the main inspiration behind the design.</p>
      <p>The idea was to create a form that would resemble the nature of the surroundings, but not blend in completely to signify the spiritual importance of the Meditation Space.</p>
