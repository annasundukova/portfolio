      <p>Stage 1 final project required the design of a small structure on the coast.</p>
      <p>Students were given full freedom to choose their programme.</p>

      <p>The shape of the rocks found along the shoreline was the main inspiration behind the design.</p>

      <p>Stage 1 began with an exploration of space. Students were asked to choose a theme for inspiration and interpret it in space through a series of small models.</p>
      <p>I chose “Storm” &ndash; a classic from The Four Seasons by Antonio Vivaldi as my inspiration.</p>
      <p>The three conceptual models are a physical interpretation of the atmosphere of a sea storm &ndash; sharp rays of light piercing through storm-clouds, wind, waves, thunder and lighting, a feeling of tension, movement and expressive dynamics, which I found myself imagining while listening to this piece of music.</p>
