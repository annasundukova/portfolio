      <p>The Meditation Space is a project I developped in my first year at the Glasgow School of Art.</p>
      <p>It is a timber pod designed for one or two people willing to relax and experience the soothing effect of silent contemplation of the beauty of surrounding nature.</p> 
      <p>Located on a rocky seashore in Portencross, Scotland, across the sea from the Isle of Arran, the site has beautiful surroundings. The view towards Arran is especially breathtaking during sunsets... </p>
      <p>The idea was to create a form that would resemble the nature of the surroundings, but not blend in completely to signify the spiritual importance of the Meditation Space.</p>

      <p>Every issue is a collection of words and pictures dedicated to a single theme. The first issue is dedicated to Berlin - the city where it all started.</p>

       <p>CAST is Centre for Advanced and Sustainable Textiles - final project of my BArch degree at the Glasgow School of Art.</p>
       $
       <p>CAST is a space dedicated to design, research and development of sustainable textiles and materials.</p>
       $
       <p>Designing the building, I wanted to achieve an atmosphere of a creative laboratory, where learning from each other, collaborating and exchanging ideas is the main working principle.</p> 
       $
       <p>All spaces are designed to be visually and spatially connected to each other and to the surrounding nature to create free flow of movement and open views in and around the building, celebrating the process of creation and textile production and paying tribute to the beauty of surrounding nature.</p>
       $
       <p>The Centre includes specialist textile workshops and designer studios, a gallery, an event venue and a cafe.</p>
       $
       <p>A space where creativity can flourish should inspire.</p>
       $
       <p>At the same time it should be reserved enough to avoid overwhelming emotions that are too strong and can be distractive for the creative mind.</p>
       $
       <p>CAST is, therefore, a composition of simple orthogonal forms and reduced material palette of concrete and glass, which creates the composed atmosphere necessary to allow the creative process to unfold unrestrained against a neutral background.</p>
       $
       <p>Flow of people, ideas, nature, views, air, sounds and scents is the magic that happens in-between the space - this happens in the orangery, which connects the separate units.</p>

      <p>Culture Kitchen is a project that aims to regenerate, activate and enliven a disarranged and disregarded area in the Southside of Glasgow, UK.</p>
      <p>Culture Kitchen is located in one of the most culturally, socially and ethnically diverse areas of the city.</p> 
      <p>At the moment, there is little engagement between different community groups. The urban environment in the area does not provide any spaces or places, where people could come and spend their time together.</p>
      <p>The design proposal is an urban farming hub and dining space, which seeks to promote healthy eating culture among city dwellers.</p> 
      <p>The concept was inspired by the principles of Food Diplomacy, which perceives food as a medium that can facilitate natural social bonding within communities. The core idea of the project is good food bringing people together.</p>
      <p>Culture Kitchen pavilion is built from used cargo shipping containers, repurposed to accommodate the various spaces.</p>
      <p>The pavillion is surrounded by allotments and gardens, which will create a fresh and lively burst of greenery on the otherwise bleak and greyish site.</p>
