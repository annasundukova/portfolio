      <p>Year 1 final project required the design of a small structure on the coast.</p>
      <p>Students were given full freedom to choose their programme.</p>
      <p>The Meditation Space is a timber pod for a few people to enjoy soothing effect of the beauty of the surrounding nature.</p>
      <p>The shape of the rocks found along the shoreline was the main inspiration behind the design.</p>
      <p>The idea was to create a form that would resemble the nature of the surroundings, but not blend in completely to signify the spiritual importance of the Meditation Space.</p>

    description: """
      <p>Year 1 began with an exploration of space. Students were asked to choose a theme for inspiration and interpret it in space through a series of small models.</p>
      <p>I chose “Storm” - a classic from The Four Seasons by Antonio Vivaldi as my inspiration.</p>
      <p>The three conceptual models are entered around the aesthetics and atmospheres of a powerful sea storm - sharp rays of light piercing through storm-clouds, wind, waves, thunder and lighting, a feeling of tension, movement and expressive dynamics, which I found myself imagining while listening to this piece of music. </p>
